<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> Hey guys my name is Xochlit Ruacho. I am thirteen years old and in the ninth grade. This is my first time making a website for my own.</p>
<br>

<h2>My Interest</h2>
<p>I really like anime. I love being on Netflix and pinterest. My hobbies are reading, being around my friends, and helping others. I also like bears. </p>
<br>

<h2> When I grow up</h2>
<p>WhenI grow I would like to be a teacher or a forensic anthropologist. I would want to become a teacher to give back to the teachers that helped me through the years. I would also want to become a froensic anthropologist to help people discover how people were unrightfully undone.</p>
